# MEGAGAME 2026: SNES to JavaScript Port Plan

## Context

We're porting **MEGAGAME 2026**, a 1.5MB LoROM SNES action platformer (Mega Man X2), to a native JavaScript game using plain HTML5 Canvas. The ROM is at `mega-game-raw.sfc` (binary). The ROM contains story references to Mega Man X characters (Sigma, Zero, X-Hunters, Dr. Cain).

**Goal:** A playable browser game — not an emulator wrapper.

## Plan 1.0 — ROM-Based Sprite Extraction (ABANDONED)

### Summary

Our original approach was to extract all sprite graphics directly from the SNES ROM data, decoding tiles, palettes, and animation frames from raw ROM bytes. This involved:

1. **ROM Parsing Pipeline** — Built hex parser, LoROM mapper, 4bpp tile decoder, and SNES palette decoder. All working correctly — tiles and palettes decode fine.

2. **CX4 Coprocessor Reverse Engineering** — Disassembled the CX4 DMA sprite routine at `$08:CA5C`, decoded the DMA transfer table at `$05:$9609` (112 entries, 6-byte format), and mapped out the full animation system (11 animations, 19 sprite defs, 3-byte frame entries at `$2F:D4D6`).

3. **OAM Layout Discovery** — Decoded the CX4 sub-sprite system at `$0D:$B01E` (variable-count defs per frame, up to 31 sub-sprites), and confirmed a 4-block OAM layout: head, upper-body-left, upper-body-right, and legs.

4. **DMA Tile Remapping** — Each of the 19 sprite defs remaps VRAM tiles 0-31 to different positions in the ROM tilesheet at `0x168000`. Wrote `sprite-frames.js` with per-def tile remap tables.

### Why It Failed

**The CX4 coprocessor made this approach impractical.** The Capcom CX4 (Hitachi HG51B169 DSP) is a custom coprocessor that handles player sprite assembly at runtime. Key problems:

- **Runtime code injection**: The CX4 uploads wrapper routines to WRAM at `$7E:2680-$7E:2692` during initialization. These routines are NOT in the cartridge ROM — they're generated by the CX4 chip itself. Without emulating the CX4, we cannot reproduce these routines.

- **Complex multi-layer sprite assembly**: The CX4's Build OAM function (`op00_00`) assembles up to 31 sub-sprites per frame, including 8-9 body blocks plus 22-23 detail/effect overlays (8x8 sprites for outline details, helmet gem, buster glow, etc.). Our simplified 4-block layout captured the basic shape but missed all the detail sprites that make the character look correct.

- **Missing leg tile source**: Leg tiles (VRAM positions 64, 65, 80, 81) are loaded by a separate init mechanism not part of the main DMA table. Tiles 64-65 were found at ROM `$2F:$8D40`, but tiles 80-81 appear to be CX4-generated at runtime. We had to resort to savestate extraction as a fallback.

- **Palette runtime modification**: ROM palette 14 is correct structurally, but the game modifies palettes at runtime for charge effects, damage flashing, etc. The savestate showed palette 14 as all-zeros at the expected CGRAM position.

- **Net result**: After weeks of reverse engineering, the rendered sprites were recognizable but visually broken — wrong colors, missing detail tiles, garbled leg tiles. The CX4 does too much runtime processing to replicate from static ROM analysis alone.

### What Was Preserved

The ROM parsing pipeline was fully removed in Plan 2.1. All `src/rom/` files, `sprite-frames.js`, and `asset-map.json` have been deleted. Background rendering now uses pre-rendered PNG images from MMX-Online-Deathmatch stage assets.

All reverse engineering findings are preserved below in the **Appendix** for reference.

## Plan 2.0 — MMX Deathmatch Sprite Source (CURRENT)

### New Approach

We discovered [MMX-Online-Deathmatch](https://github.com/gamemaker19/MMX-Online-Deathmatch), an open-source Mega Man X fan game with complete, high-quality sprite assets. The project contains:

- **Pre-made PNG spritesheets** with all character animations laid out cleanly
- **JSON animation definitions** with precise frame rects, durations, offsets, and POI (point of interest) data for projectile spawn positions
- **Multiple character spritesheets** (X, Zero, Vile, Sigma, Axl, 26+ Mavericks)
- **Effects spritesheets** for projectiles, explosions, and other VFX

All needed assets are copied into our `assets/` folder — nothing references the `MMX-Online-Deathmatch/` directory at runtime.

### Current Status

**Working:**
- Player spritesheet (`assets/XDefault.png`) loaded and rendering correctly
- 20 animations in `src/entities/sprite-data.js` (generated from MMX Deathmatch JSONs)
- Full state machine: warp_in, idle, run, jump, fall, land, wall_slide, dash, dash_end, hurt, die
- Warp-in animation plays at level start (input locked during animation)
- Land animation plays on landing from air (2-frame squash, jump-cancellable)
- Dash-end animation plays after ground dash ends (brief stand-up transition)
- Die state on 0 HP (animation plays, player stops)
- Shooting animation overlay: 6 shoot variants (idle, run, jump, fall, dash, wall_slide)
- Buster projectile sprites from `assets/effects.png` (8x6 shot + 3-frame fade on wall hit)
- Projectile spawn from hand POI (`hx`/`hy` buster position per animation frame)
- Wall slide flip fix (sprite inverted for correct wall-facing)
- Wall slide shooting fires in correct direction (away from wall)
- Left-facing sprite rendering stable (flip axis fixed at character center)
- **Highway stage** background from MMX-Deathmatch PNG assets (parallax + backwall + background layers)
- Stage collision rasterized from map.json polygon data onto 16x16 tile grid
- Spawn points loaded from map.json
- Full movement state machine (run, jump, wall-jump, dash, shoot mechanics)
- **ROM dependency fully removed** — no .sfc file needed, all `src/rom/` deleted

### Plan Items

---

### 1. Finish Player Sprites (DONE)

**Completed:**
- ~~`land`~~ — Landing squash animation wired into state machine
- ~~`warp_in`~~ — Level start teleport beam plays on spawn
- ~~`die`~~ — Death animation on 0 HP
- ~~`dash_end`~~ — Brief stand-up transition after ground dash
- `crouch` — Crouching (1 frame, data exists, not wired — future if we add crouch mechanic)

---

### 2. Other Character Sprites

The MMX Deathmatch project contains spritesheets for many characters. Available at `MMX-Online-Deathmatch/LevelEditor/assets/spritesheets/`:

#### Priority characters:
| Character | Spritesheet | JSON Folder | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Zero** | `ZeroDefault.png` | `sprites/zero/` | Second protagonist, sword-based |
| **Vile** | `VileDefault.png` | `sprites/vile/` | Enemy/boss character |
| **Sigma** | `SigmaDefault.png` | `sprites/sigma/` | Final boss |

#### Additional characters (lower priority):
- `AxlDefault.png` — Axl (X7/X8 character)
- 26+ Maverick boss spritesheets (`CrushCrawfish.png`, `StormEagle.png`, etc.)
- Each has corresponding JSON animation definitions

#### Implementation plan:
1. Copy needed spritesheets to `assets/`
2. Run `build_sprite_module.py` (or a variant) to generate sprite-data modules for each character
3. Create entity classes extending `Entity` with character-specific state machines
4. Enemies can use simpler AI state machines (patrol, chase, attack patterns)

---

### 3. Shooting & Projectile System (DONE)

All shooting features are implemented:
- Buster shot sprites from `effects.png` (8x6 sprite, direction-aware rendering)
- 3-frame fade/hit animation on wall collision
- Hand POI-based spawn position (`hx`/`hy` per animation frame)
- Max 3 shots, 8-frame cooldown
- 6 shoot animation overlays (idle, run, jump, fall, dash, wall_slide)

**Future:**
- Charged shot — Hold-to-charge buster mechanic (stretch goal)

---

### Implementation Priority

1. ~~**Shooting overlay animations**~~ — DONE
2. ~~**Projectile spawn from POI**~~ — DONE
3. ~~**Projectile sprites**~~ — DONE
4. ~~**ROM removal + stage assets**~~ — DONE (highway stage PNG backgrounds + polygon collision)
5. ~~**Player animation states**~~ — DONE (warp_in, land, die, dash_end)
6. **Enemy characters** — Start with one Maverick as a test enemy **<-- NEXT**
7. **Boss fights** — Multi-phase boss AI
8. **Charged shot** — Hold-to-charge buster mechanic

## Appendix: ROM Reverse Engineering Findings

_Preserved from Plan 1.0 for reference. This data is accurate but the tile-based rendering approach was abandoned in favor of PNG spritesheets._

### Hardware: CX4 Coprocessor

The cartridge PCB is **SHVC-2DC0N-01** with a **Capcom CX4** coprocessor (Hitachi HG51B169 DSP, 20 MHz). ROM header chipset byte = `$F3` (CX4 confirmed). The CX4 is mapped at `$6000-$7FFF` in banks `$00-$3F`.

The CX4 handles:
- Player sprite DMA (tile streaming from ROM to VRAM)
- OAM table construction (assembling sprite objects from parts)
- Wireframe 3D effects (intro sequences)
- Trigonometric calculations for scaling/rotation

### Key ROM Addresses

| Address | ROM Offset | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `$00:80BE` | `0x0000BE` | CX4 initialization |
| `$00:A8A6` | `0x00A8A6` | Player spawn: entity type `$9D` |
| `$08:85DD` | `0x0405DD` | Entity sprite handler pointer table |
| `$08:C690` | `0x044690` | Animation controller init |
| `$08:C673` | `0x044673` | Animation tick |
| `$08:CA5C` | `0x044A5C` | CX4 sprite DMA routine |
| `$2F:D4D6` | `0x17D4D6` | Player animation base (11 anims, defs 0-18) |
| `$05:9609` | `0x029609` | Player sprite DMA transfer table (112 entries) |

### Animation System

3-byte frame format: `[duration] [flags] [sprite_def_index]`
- 11 animations, 19 sprite defs
- DMA remaps tiles 0-31 per frame, legs (64+) loaded at init
- Palette 14 at ROM `0x02BFC0`

### DMA Transfer Entry Format (6 bytes)

```
[0] Tile count (×16 = byte count)
[1] Source addr low
[2] Source addr high
[3] Source bank ($2D = player tilesheet at 0x168000)
[4] VRAM dest low
[5] VRAM dest high (bit 15 = last entry flag)
```

### 4-Block OAM Layout

```
head:   VRAM tiles (0,1,16,17)  at pixel (16, 2)
ubodyL: VRAM tiles (4,5,20,21)  at pixel (12, 16)
ubodyR: VRAM tiles (6,7,22,23)  at pixel (20, 16)
legs:   VRAM tiles (64,65,80,81) at pixel (16, 32)
```
