# MEGAGAME 2026: Mega Man X Browser Game

## Context

A Mega Man X-style action platformer built with plain HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. All sprite and stage assets sourced from [MMX-Online-Deathmatch](https://github.com/gamemaker19/MMX-Online-Deathmatch), an open-source fan game with complete, high-quality PNG spritesheets and JSON animation data. Originally started as a SNES ROM port (Plan 1.0, abandoned due to CX4 coprocessor complexity).

**Goal:** A playable browser game with authentic MMX gameplay — not an emulator wrapper.

---

## Plan 1.0 — ROM-Based Sprite Extraction (ABANDONED)

### Summary

Our original approach was to extract all sprite graphics directly from the SNES ROM data, decoding tiles, palettes, and animation frames from raw ROM bytes. This involved:

1. **ROM Parsing Pipeline** — Built hex parser, LoROM mapper, 4bpp tile decoder, and SNES palette decoder. All working correctly — tiles and palettes decode fine.

2. **CX4 Coprocessor Reverse Engineering** — Disassembled the CX4 DMA sprite routine at `$08:CA5C`, decoded the DMA transfer table at `$05:$9609` (112 entries, 6-byte format), and mapped out the full animation system (11 animations, 19 sprite defs, 3-byte frame entries at `$2F:D4D6`).

3. **OAM Layout Discovery** — Decoded the CX4 sub-sprite system at `$0D:$B01E` (variable-count defs per frame, up to 31 sub-sprites), and confirmed a 4-block OAM layout: head, upper-body-left, upper-body-right, and legs.

4. **DMA Tile Remapping** — Each of the 19 sprite defs remaps VRAM tiles 0-31 to different positions in the ROM tilesheet at `0x168000`. Wrote `sprite-frames.js` with per-def tile remap tables.

### Why It Failed

**The CX4 coprocessor made this approach impractical.** The Capcom CX4 (Hitachi HG51B169 DSP) is a custom coprocessor that handles player sprite assembly at runtime. Key problems:

- **Runtime code injection**: The CX4 uploads wrapper routines to WRAM at `$7E:2680-$7E:2692` during initialization. These routines are NOT in the cartridge ROM — they're generated by the CX4 chip itself. Without emulating the CX4, we cannot reproduce these routines.

- **Complex multi-layer sprite assembly**: The CX4's Build OAM function (`op00_00`) assembles up to 31 sub-sprites per frame, including 8-9 body blocks plus 22-23 detail/effect overlays (8x8 sprites for outline details, helmet gem, buster glow, etc.). Our simplified 4-block layout captured the basic shape but missed all the detail sprites that make the character look correct.

- **Missing leg tile source**: Leg tiles (VRAM positions 64, 65, 80, 81) are loaded by a separate init mechanism not part of the main DMA table. Tiles 64-65 were found at ROM `$2F:$8D40`, but tiles 80-81 appear to be CX4-generated at runtime. We had to resort to savestate extraction as a fallback.

- **Palette runtime modification**: ROM palette 14 is correct structurally, but the game modifies palettes at runtime for charge effects, damage flashing, etc. The savestate showed palette 14 as all-zeros at the expected CGRAM position.

- **Net result**: After weeks of reverse engineering, the rendered sprites were recognizable but visually broken — wrong colors, missing detail tiles, garbled leg tiles. The CX4 does too much runtime processing to replicate from static ROM analysis alone.

### What Was Preserved

The ROM parsing pipeline was fully removed in Plan 2.1. All `src/rom/` files, `sprite-frames.js`, and `asset-map.json` have been deleted. Background rendering now uses pre-rendered PNG images from MMX-Online-Deathmatch stage assets.

All reverse engineering findings are preserved below in the **Appendix** for reference.

## Plan 2.0 — MMX Deathmatch Sprite Source (CURRENT)

### New Approach

We discovered [MMX-Online-Deathmatch](https://github.com/gamemaker19/MMX-Online-Deathmatch), an open-source Mega Man X fan game with complete, high-quality sprite assets. The project contains:

- **Pre-made PNG spritesheets** with all character animations laid out cleanly
- **JSON animation definitions** with precise frame rects, durations, offsets, and POI (point of interest) data for projectile spawn positions
- **Multiple character spritesheets** (X, Zero, Vile, Sigma, Axl, 26+ Mavericks)
- **Effects spritesheets** for projectiles, explosions, and other VFX

All needed assets are copied into our `assets/` folder — nothing references the `MMX-Online-Deathmatch/` directory at runtime.

### Current Status

**Player Character (X):**
- Spritesheet: `assets/XDefault.png`, 19 animations in `sprite-data.js`
- 10-state machine: warp_in, idle, run, jump, fall, land, wall_slide, dash, hurt, die
- Warp-in animation on spawn (input locked), land squash on landing (jump-cancellable)
- Dash snaps directly to idle/run on ground (no transition anim, matches original MMX)
- 6 shoot animation overlays (idle, run, jump, fall, dash, wall_slide)
- Buster projectile from `assets/effects.png` (8x6 shot, 3-frame fade on wall hit)
- Projectile spawn from hand POI (`hx`/`hy` per animation frame)
- Wall slide: sprite flipped for wall-facing, shoots away from wall
- Dash-jump momentum: `isDashing` flag preserves 2x speed through jump/fall, clears on landing
- Charged buster: hold shoot to charge (2 levels), release for bigger animated projectile
- 8 charge particles orbit player while charging, character flashes white

**Enemies:**
- Tank Mechaniloid: patrol/turn/chase/attack/dying AI, 8 HP, fires projectiles
- Sprites from `assets/sigma_viral.png`, death explosion from `assets/effects.png`
- Full collision system: player shots hit enemies, enemy shots/body hit player

**Stage:**
- Highway stage from MMX-Deathmatch PNG assets (parallax + backwall + background layers)
- Collision rasterized from map.json polygon data onto 16x16 tile grid
- Spawn points loaded from map.json instances

**Engine:**
- Fixed 60fps game loop, keyboard input with pressed/held/released edge detection
- Tile-based AABB collision, camera viewport scrolling (256x224)
- Asset loader for images + JSON, no ROM dependency

### Plan Items

---

### 1. Finish Player Sprites (DONE)

**Completed:**
- ~~`land`~~ — Landing squash animation wired into state machine (jump-cancellable)
- ~~`warp_in`~~ — Level start teleport beam plays on spawn
- ~~`die`~~ — Death animation on 0 HP
- `crouch` — Crouching (1 frame, data exists, not wired — future if we add crouch mechanic)

**Note:** `dash_end` was initially added but removed after research showed original MMX has no dash-end transition — X snaps directly to idle/run.

---

### 2. Other Character Sprites

The MMX Deathmatch project contains spritesheets for many characters. Available at `MMX-Online-Deathmatch/LevelEditor/assets/spritesheets/`:

#### Priority characters:
| Character | Spritesheet | JSON Folder | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Zero** | `ZeroDefault.png` | `sprites/zero/` | Second protagonist, sword-based |
| **Vile** | `VileDefault.png` | `sprites/vile/` | Enemy/boss character |
| **Sigma** | `SigmaDefault.png` | `sprites/sigma/` | Final boss |

#### Additional characters (lower priority):
- `AxlDefault.png` — Axl (X7/X8 character)
- 26+ Maverick boss spritesheets (`CrushCrawfish.png`, `StormEagle.png`, etc.)
- Each has corresponding JSON animation definitions

#### Implementation plan:
1. Copy needed spritesheets to `assets/`
2. Run `build_sprite_module.py` (or a variant) to generate sprite-data modules for each character
3. Create entity classes extending `Entity` with character-specific state machines
4. Enemies can use simpler AI state machines (patrol, chase, attack patterns)

---

### 3. Shooting & Projectile System (DONE)

All shooting features are implemented:
- Buster shot sprites from `effects.png` (8x6 sprite, direction-aware rendering)
- 3-frame fade/hit animation on wall collision
- Hand POI-based spawn position (`hx`/`hy` per animation frame)
- Max 3 shots, 8-frame cooldown
- 6 shoot animation overlays (idle, run, jump, fall, dash, wall_slide)

---

### 4. Dash-Jump Momentum (DONE)

- `isDashing` boolean flag preserves dash speed (2x multiplier) through jump/fall states
- Set on dash entry, persists through jump-cancel and air states
- Cleared on landing (land state), wall slide, hurt, or dash expiring on ground
- Matches MMX-Online-Deathmatch behavior: speed recomputed per frame (not inertia), releasing direction = stop

---

### 5. Charged Buster Shot (DONE)

Hold shoot to charge, release for bigger projectile:
- **Charge Level 1** (0.75s / 45 frames): buster2 projectile, damage 2, speed 6.0
- **Charge Level 2** (1.75s / 105 frames): buster3 projectile, damage 3, speed 7.0
- Normal lemon fires on press, charge builds while holding, charged shot fires on release
- 8 charge particles orbit player at 24px radius, converging toward center
- Character flashes white while charging (lighter composite at 40% alpha)
- Animated projectile sprites with startup → loop → fade phases
- Charge cleared on hurt/die

Sprite sources (all from effects.png):
- buster2: 8 frames (5 startup, 3 loop), buster3: 5 frames (2 startup, 3 loop)
- charge_part_1 (level 1): 2x2 → 1x1 pixels, charge_part_2 (level 2): 4x4 → 1x1 pixels

---

### 6. Enemy Characters (DONE — Tank Mechaniloid)

First enemy implemented: **Tank Mechaniloid** from `sigma_viral.png`.

**AI State Machine (5 states):**
- `patrol` — Walk left/right within 150px of spawn, turn at ledges/walls
- `turn` — Play 1-frame turn animation (10 frames), then flip direction
- `chase` — Move toward player when spotted within 130px sight range
- `attack` — Stop and fire projectile when player is within 125px horizontal, 30px vertical
- `dying` — Play 8-frame explosion animation from effects.png, then remove

**Combat:**
- 8 HP, takes damage from player buster shots (normal and charged)
- Fires 8x7 pixel projectile (damage 2, speed 3.0, 30-frame lifetime)
- Contact damage: 3 damage on body touch (60-frame cooldown)
- Projectile spawn from POI offset (20px forward, 15px up from feet)

**Collision System (in gameplay.js):**
- Player shots vs enemies: AABB overlap check, shot destroyed on hit
- Charged shots use larger hitboxes (20x16 for level 1, 32x28 for level 2)
- Enemy shots vs player: triggers `player.takeDamage()` with knockback direction
- Enemy body vs player: contact damage with cooldown

**Sprites:** 4 animations (walk: 2 frames, turn: 1 frame, shoot: 2 frames, proj: 1 frame), all from `sigma_viral.png` row y=991-1023. Death explosion: 8 frames from `effects.png`.

---

### 9. More Enemy Types (DONE — Hopper + Bird)

#### Hopper Mechaniloid (`hopper-enemy.js`)

**AI State Machine (4 states):**
- `idle` — Waits on ground, faces player, timer before next hop
- `hop` — Jumps toward player (3-frame hop animation), lands → idle or attack
- `attack` — Melee slash when in close range (4-frame looping animation with forward hitbox)
- `dying` — 8-frame explosion from effects.png, then remove

**Combat:**
- 6 HP, takes damage from player buster shots
- Melee attack: 4 damage, 32x15 forward hitbox extending from body
- Contact damage: 3 damage on body touch (60-frame cooldown)
- Hops toward player at 1.2 px/frame, jump velocity -3.5

**Sprites:** 3 animations (idle: 1 frame, hop: 3 frames, attack: 4 frames), all from `sigma_viral.png` y=991-1021. Alignment: botmid.

#### Bird Mechaniloid (`bird-enemy.js`)

**AI State Machine (3 states):**
- `fly` — Patrols horizontally with sine-wave vertical oscillation (20px amplitude)
- `swoop` — Dives toward player position at 2.5 px/frame, then returns to patrol height
- `dying` — 8-frame explosion from effects.png, then remove

**Combat:**
- 4 HP, takes damage from player buster shots
- Contact damage: 3 damage on body touch (60-frame cooldown)
- No projectile attack — relies on swooping and body contact

**Sprites:** 1 animation (fly: 3 frames looping wing-flap), from `sigma_viral.png` y=999-1023. Alignment: center (not botmid — flying enemy doesn't anchor to ground). No tile collision.

---

### 10. Classic MMX HP Bar (DONE)

Replaced the simple rectangle health bar with the authentic MMX vertical segmented bar using sprites from `effects.png`.

**Sprite assets (all from effects.png, alignment: botmid):**

| Sprite | Source Rect (x,y → w×h) | Purpose |
|--------|------------------------|---------|
| Health base (X) | (2,55) → 14×16 | Bottom piece with character icon |
| Health full | (2,51) → 14×2 | Filled cell (one per HP point) |
| Health empty | (2,37) → 14×2 | Empty cell |
| Health top cap | (34,13) → 14×4 | Top piece capping the bar |

**Two layouts (toggle with L key):**
- **Vertical** (default) — Classic MMX style, upper-left corner, base at bottom, cells stacked upward
- **Horizontal** — Same sprites rotated 90° CW, upper-left corner, base on left, cells extending right

**Screen position:** Upper-left corner (x=8, y=8 padding).

---

### 11. Enemy Damage Flash + Shot Hit Effect (DONE)

**Enemy damage flash (white flash on hit):**
- All enemy types (Tank, Hopper, Bird) flash near-white for 6 frames (~0.1s) when hit
- Technique: `globalCompositeOperation = 'lighter'` at 0.7 alpha (same as charge flash, stronger)
- `hitFlashTimer` set to 6 in `onHit()`, decremented each frame

**Shot hit effect (buster fade on enemy hit):**
- Buster shots now play the 3-frame fade animation when hitting enemies (same as wall hits)
- Changed `shot.active = false` to `shot.fading = true` in `_checkPlayerShotsVsEnemies()`

---

### 12. Gamepad Support (DONE)

**Controller mapping tool** (`tools/map-controller.py`):
- Python/pygame script walks through each action (shoot, jump, dash, d-pad, analog stick)
- Captures axis baselines to handle controllers with non-zero trigger resting values (8BitDo triggers rest at -1.0)
- Outputs `tools/controller-map.json`

**Browser Gamepad API integration** (`src/engine/input.js`):
- Polls `navigator.getGamepads()` each frame, merges with keyboard input
- D-pad (buttons 12-15) and analog stick (axes 0/1 with 0.3 deadzone) both map to directional actions
- Note: browser button indices may differ from SDL/pygame (e.g. 8BitDo X button = SDL 2, browser 3)

---

### 13. Import Second Stage Map (DONE — Chill Penguin / Frozen Town)

Imported the Chill Penguin stage ("frozentown") from MMX-Online-Deathmatch.

**Stage details:**
- Internal name: `frozentown` (displayName: "frozen town")
- Dimensions: 1792 × 767 px (multi-tier vertical layout, much taller than highway's 224px)
- Kill zone at y=583 (death pit in the middle section)
- Parallax background with 0.5x scroll on both X and Y axes
- Purple night sky with snow-covered mountains

**What was added:**
1. Copied `background.png`, `backwall.png`, `parallax.png`, `foreground.png`, `map.json` to `assets/levels/frozentown_*`
2. Updated `level.js` to parse Kill Zone rectangle instances (not just a Y threshold)
3. Updated `gameplay.js`: vertical parallax scrolling, per-stage enemy layouts, kill zone death check, foreground layer rendering
4. Updated `index.html`: preloads both stages, F1/F2 switches between highway and frozentown
5. Per-stage enemy spawn positions (tanks, hoppers, birds placed at appropriate positions per stage)
6. Also imported `highway_foreground.png` which was previously missing

**Stage import standard — always copy all 5 files from the source map directory:**
1. `background.png` → `assets/levels/{name}_background.png` (main tilemap, scrolls 1:1)
2. `backwall.png` → `assets/levels/{name}_backwall.png` (behind background, scrolls 1:1)
3. `parallax.png` → `assets/levels/{name}_parallax.png` (distant layer, scrolls 0.5x)
4. `foreground.png` → `assets/levels/{name}_foreground.png` (drawn over player/enemies)
5. `map.json` → `assets/levels/{name}_map.json` (collision polygons, spawn points, kill zones)

**Note:** More stages to be imported later. The asset pipeline (`loadStage()`) loads all 5 files automatically — foreground gracefully skipped if missing.

---

### 14. Health Recovery Items (DONE)

Health pickup items that restore HP cell-by-cell, matching original MMX behavior.

**Entity:** `src/entities/health-pickup.js` — `HealthPickup` class extending `Entity`.

**Two sizes:**

| Size | Sprite Source (effects.png) | Heal Amount | Hitbox |
|------|---------------------------|-------------|--------|
| Small | y=138, h=8, frames at x=6(8w), 22(10w), 40(10w), 58(10w) | 4 HP | 8×8 |
| Large | y=150, h=12, frames at x=3(14w), 19(16w), 37(16w), 55(16w) | 8 HP | 14×12 |

**Animation:** 7-step bounce sequence [0,1,2,3,2,1,0], 2 frames per step, looping.

**Spawning:**
- **Fixed map placements**: Parsed from map.json `Large Health` / `Small Health` instances (highway: 1 small, frozentown: 3 large). No despawn timer.
- **Enemy drops**: 10% large health, then 30% small health (rolled independently). Despawns after 480 frames (8s), blinks last 120 frames (2s).

**Collection:** Player must overlap pickup AND have `hp < maxHp`. Sets pickup inactive, adds `healAmount` to `player.healQueue`.

**Heal queue:** In `gameplay.js` update, ticks +1 HP every 3 frames from `player.healQueue`. HP bar reads `player.hp` directly so it fills cell-by-cell automatically.

**Physics:** Gravity + `resolveVertical` to land on ground (same as enemies).

---

### 15. Boss Fights (DONE — Chill Penguin)

First Maverick boss fight in the frozentown stage.

**Entity:** `src/entities/chill-penguin.js` — `ChillPenguin` class extending `Entity`.
**Sprites:** All from `assets/mavericks.png` (botmid alignment).

**AI States (6):**

| State | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `idle` | Face player, walk toward if >120px away, countdown 40-80 frames then pick random attack |
| `shoot` | 2-frame windup → fire ice projectile (speed 4.2, damage 3, 45-frame lifetime) → idle |
| `slide` | 2-frame windup → belly slide at 5.8 px/f, bounces off walls, decelerates after 45f, stops at 75f. Has armor (no hurt interruption). Hitbox switches to 34x24 (wider, shorter) |
| `blow` | 2-frame windup → push player horizontally 2.5 px/f if in front & within 180px, lasts 96 frames → idle |
| `hurt` | 6-frame recoil (skipped during slide — armor) |
| `dying` | 8-frame explosion from effects.png |

**Key values:** 32 HP, contact damage 3 (60-frame cooldown), slide damage 3, ice shot 14x14 sprite (center-aligned, from mavericks.png at 194,232).

**Invincibility:** 45 frames (~0.75s) after taking damage, same pattern as player — `invincibleTimer` blocks damage in `onHit()`, sprite flashes (skip render every other 4 frames). Slide armor still applies on top (no hurt state interruption during slide).

**Boss HP bar:** Vertical segmented bar on right side of screen (x = SCREEN_W - 8 - 14 = 234), same BASE/FULL/EMPTY/CAP sprites as player bar from effects.png. Only shown when boss is on or near screen (64px margin via `_isBossNearScreen()`). Hidden during dying state.

**Spawn:** Configurable per-stage in `_spawnEnemies()` via `bossSpawns` object. Currently: frozentown at x=1650, y=150. Boss is stored in `this.boss` (separate from `this.enemies[]` — no health drops on boss death). Designed to be easily moved to a dedicated boss room later.

**Sprite animations (all from mavericks.png, botmid alignment):**

| Animation | Frames | Source Rects | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| idle | 2, loop | (221,77) 38x36, (43,77) 38x36 | dur=8 each |
| run | 4, loop | y=266-310, 35x37-39 | dur=6 each |
| shoot | 5, once | 2 windup + 3 shoot | POI(18,-22) on frames 2+ |
| slide | 3, once | 2 windup + (4,133) 40x31 | Slide pose held (dur=999) |
| blow | 4, loopFrom=2 | 2 windup + 2 blow | POI(23,-22), loops blow frames |
| jump | 1 | (181,127) 37x38 | ox=1 |
| fall | 1 | (60,20) 35x44 | ox=-1, oy=6 |
| land | 3, once | 3 frames | dur 4/6/4 |
| hurt | 2, loop | (175,165) 38x47, (221,169) 35x41 | dur=3 each |
| die | 1 | (221,169) 35x41 | oy=3 |

**Integration (gameplay.js):**
- Import `ChillPenguin` from `chill-penguin.js`
- Boss spawned in `_spawnEnemies()`, assigned `mavericksSprite` + `effectsSprite`
- Boss update + `checkPlayerCollision()` after enemy loop
- Separate `_checkPlayerShotsVsBoss()` method (same shot hitbox logic as enemies)
- Boss rendered between pickups and player layers
- Boss HP bar in `_renderHUD()` with screen proximity check
- Boss cleared (`this.boss = null`) when death animation finishes

**Asset pipeline:**
- `mavericks.png` copied from `MMX-Online-Deathmatch/LevelEditor/assets/spritesheets/` to `assets/`
- Loaded in `index.html` as key `'mavericksSprite'`

## Key Technical Notes

**Grounded detection quirk:** `resolveVertical()` in `collision.js` only returns `grounded: true` when `dy > 0` (moving downward). If any ground state sets `this.vy = 0`, `dy` becomes 0, and `grounded` returns `false` — causing rapid state oscillation (e.g. idle → fall → land → idle) with visible shaking. **All ground states MUST apply gravity** (`this.vy += P.GRAVITY`) and let the collision system resolve the position. This was the root cause of multiple bugs during land/dash implementation.

**Sprite alignment:** All player sprites are aligned bottom-center (feet anchor). The rendering offset `ox`/`oy` is per-frame. Flip axis is always at `feetX` (character center) for left-facing sprites. Wall slide sprites face toward the wall, so flip is inverted.

**MMX dash behavior:** Original MMX has NO dash-end transition animation. X snaps directly from dash to idle/run. Early attempt to add a `dash_end` state was removed after verifying this against the MMX-Online-Deathmatch source (CharState.cs).

**Charge composite rendering:** Canvas2D `globalCompositeOperation = 'lighter'` with `globalAlpha = 0.4` creates a convincing "charge flash" without shaders. The sprite is drawn twice — once normal, once with lighter blend mode.

**Collision data source:** Map JSON contains both `mergedWalls` and `Collision Shape` instances. `mergedWalls` is for **AI pathfinding only** (6 rough polygons in frozentown). `Collision Shape` instances are the **actual collision boundaries** (43 precise rectangles in frozentown, 12 in highway). Always use `Collision Shape` instances for tile-grid rasterization.

**Player hitbox (original MMX):** The original game uses `Rect(0, 0, 18, 34)` with `botmid` alignment, meaning the hitbox is 18×34 centered horizontally on the character's feet position. Our implementation matches: `WIDTH=18, HEIGHT=34, HITBOX_X=0, HITBOX_Y=0`.

**External forces on player:** Any code that pushes the player (e.g. boss blow attack) MUST use `resolveHorizontal`/`resolveVertical` from `collision.js` — never modify `player.x`/`player.y` directly, or the player can clip through walls.

**Original MMX screen width:** The original game uses 298×224, not 256×224. Our viewport is 307×224 (~20% wider than SNES 256, slightly wider than original MMX).

## Appendix: ROM Reverse Engineering Findings

_Preserved from Plan 1.0 for reference. This data is accurate but the tile-based rendering approach was abandoned in favor of PNG spritesheets._

### Hardware: CX4 Coprocessor

The cartridge PCB is **SHVC-2DC0N-01** with a **Capcom CX4** coprocessor (Hitachi HG51B169 DSP, 20 MHz). ROM header chipset byte = `$F3` (CX4 confirmed). The CX4 is mapped at `$6000-$7FFF` in banks `$00-$3F`.

The CX4 handles:
- Player sprite DMA (tile streaming from ROM to VRAM)
- OAM table construction (assembling sprite objects from parts)
- Wireframe 3D effects (intro sequences)
- Trigonometric calculations for scaling/rotation

### Key ROM Addresses

| Address | ROM Offset | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `$00:80BE` | `0x0000BE` | CX4 initialization |
| `$00:A8A6` | `0x00A8A6` | Player spawn: entity type `$9D` |
| `$08:85DD` | `0x0405DD` | Entity sprite handler pointer table |
| `$08:C690` | `0x044690` | Animation controller init |
| `$08:C673` | `0x044673` | Animation tick |
| `$08:CA5C` | `0x044A5C` | CX4 sprite DMA routine |
| `$2F:D4D6` | `0x17D4D6` | Player animation base (11 anims, defs 0-18) |
| `$05:9609` | `0x029609` | Player sprite DMA transfer table (112 entries) |

### Animation System

3-byte frame format: `[duration] [flags] [sprite_def_index]`
- 11 animations, 19 sprite defs
- DMA remaps tiles 0-31 per frame, legs (64+) loaded at init
- Palette 14 at ROM `0x02BFC0`

### DMA Transfer Entry Format (6 bytes)

```
[0] Tile count (×16 = byte count)
[1] Source addr low
[2] Source addr high
[3] Source bank ($2D = player tilesheet at 0x168000)
[4] VRAM dest low
[5] VRAM dest high (bit 15 = last entry flag)
```

### 4-Block OAM Layout

```
head:   VRAM tiles (0,1,16,17)  at pixel (16, 2)
ubodyL: VRAM tiles (4,5,20,21)  at pixel (12, 16)
ubodyR: VRAM tiles (6,7,22,23)  at pixel (20, 16)
legs:   VRAM tiles (64,65,80,81) at pixel (16, 32)
```
